# CodeAlpha_Project_Name.
I participated in a Java Programming Internship at CodeAlpha, where I worked on various projects to enhance my skills in object-oriented programming and Java application development. During this internship, I completed three tasks:

Grades Calculator - A tool for calculating students' grades, averages, and performance statistics.
Online Quiz Platform - An application that allows users to manage their accounts with features like deposits, withdrawals, and balance checks.
Hotel Reservation System - A system that enables users to search for available rooms, make reservations, and process payments.
This internship was a valuable learning experience, helping me to strengthen my Java development skills.
